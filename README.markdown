# Odeko Checkout interview project: Katie McGinley

## Instructions
To run this project, you must generate a client secret from (https://secret-shore-94903.herokuapp.com/accounts/2903b0e1-7446-4d3e-9018-901b01d43cb5)[here], or use a previously generated one.

Make a copy of the .env.example, named .env, and replace the placeholder for the client secret with the one you generated.

If you have not yet installed the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

You can then use the following command to start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```
