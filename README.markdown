# Odeko Checkout interview project: Katie McGinley

## Instructions
To run this project, you must generate a client secret from (https://secret-shore-94903.herokuapp.com/accounts/2903b0e1-7446-4d3e-9018-901b01d43cb5)[here], or use a previously generated one.

Make a copy of the .env.example, named .env, and replace the placeholder for the client secret with the one you generated.
